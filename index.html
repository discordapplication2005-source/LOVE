    <p>To the Love of my life💕</p>
    <p>I hope whatever I am writing brings smile to your face, just like you bring light into my day everyday. I've been thinking about how much you mean to me, and I couldn't let another moment pass without telling you.</p>
    <p>You ask me about my favourite song, I would like to tell you that you are my favourite song. Always stuck in my head, comforting, and full of warmth. Everytime I'm talking to you, the wrold feels softer, brighter, and a little more magical. I want you to know that I will always love you.</p>
    <p>~ your sunshine</p>
